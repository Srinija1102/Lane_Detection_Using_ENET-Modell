# Lane_Detection_Using_ENET-Modell
The TRH-ENet model achieves high accuracy with low latency, making it suitable for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and self-driving applications. The project ensures lane detection under varying conditions such as low-light, occlusions, and complex road structures.
